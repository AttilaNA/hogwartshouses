### *Locus Omnis!*

Dumbledore tasked prof. McGonagall with writing a list of all rooms on a piece of parchment. The deadline is tomorrow, so she needs your help.

1. A list of all rooms is returned when calling the <span style="color: yellow">/rooms</span> endpoint with the GET method.

### *Invenio Locus!*

"Keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change." This turned out to be correct, which makes it really easy to get lost. Poor Luna just got lost in the building and the only thing she remembers is the room number. Help Luna find her room by its number.

1. The room with the specified ID is returned when calling the <span style="color: yellow">/rooms/{roomId}</span> endpoint with the GET method.
